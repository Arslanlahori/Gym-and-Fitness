            Weight management: Regular exercise can help with weight management by burning calories and building muscle
            mass, making it easier to maintain a healthy weight and body composition.

            Improved sleep: Exercise has been shown to improve sleep quality and duration, helping individuals to feel
            more
            rested and energized throughout the day.
